h2. <a name="migrate">Migrate your current project from Groovy template engine to Rythm</a>

PlayRythm is designed to support smooth migrating from Groovy template engine.

By default "system" (i.e. groovy) template engine is used. Meaning without special annotation, controller's render request will be handled by groovy template engine. And this give developer a good base to move to Rythm template step by step.

# Step 1, rewrite a groovy template using rythm syntax.
# Step 2, annotate the relevant controller action method with <code>@UseRythmTemplateEngine</code> annotation

Continue the above steps until all your controller migrated to rythm, you can annotate the controller with <code>@UseRythmTemplateEngine</code> and drop all that from action method

p(note). -Tip: enclose all your rythm template with @#{verbatim}@ and @#{/verbatim}@ can help you avoid groovy compile exception and does not impact your rythm template-. This is not true. The groovy template engine will still parse the expressions. See "Resolve groovy compilation error":#conflict for workarounds.

h2. <a name="new">Create an new project and use Rythm engine from the beginning</a>

If you decide to use Rythm engine in a new project, you can add one line to your application.conf

bc. rythm.default.engine=rythm

And you can start using rythm template without <code>@UseRythmTemplateEngine</code> annotation. On the contrary if you decide one or a few controller methods should use groovy template engine for some reason, you can annotate that action with <code>@UseSystemTemplateEngine</code> annotation
